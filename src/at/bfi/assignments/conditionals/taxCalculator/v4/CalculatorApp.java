/**
 * assignment:
 * 
 * Implement an income tax calculator. You should print the correct tax rate and
 * the resulting net income. the following progressive tax rates apply (numbers
 * are gross income): 
 * 0 - 1500 EUR -> 20% 
 * 1501 - 2500 EUR -> 35% 
 * 2501 - 3500 EUR -> 45% 
 * 3501 and above -> 50%
 * 
 * Note that the assignment doesn't specify a tax progression method.
 * The correct tax calculation is as such:
 * If you earn 400 Eur, then
 * 1500 Eur are taxed with 20%,
 * 1000 Eur (1501-2500) with 35%,
 * 1000 Eur (2501-3500) with 45%,
 * and 500 Eur (3501-4000) with 50%.
