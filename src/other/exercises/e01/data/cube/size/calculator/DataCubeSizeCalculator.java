 * A question that just came up in my database course:
 * Given a data cube with a known set of dimensions,
 * and a known number of tuples per dimension,
 * how many fields are there?
 * https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/OLAP/SelfPaced/courseware/ch-on-line_analytical_processing/seq-vid-olap/?activate_block_id=i4x%3A%2F%2FDB%2FOLAP%2Fsequential%2Fseq-vid-olap
 * 
 * Thought I'd write a calculator for that.
